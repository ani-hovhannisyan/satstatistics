# satstatistics

This is the repository to reflect my research related results.
The research is about possible improvements for analysis of
precommit code changes, where developer will spent less time
than usually by using general analysis for whole source code.

this repository scrips will mainly do:
 - collect necessary data
 - prepares environment of dependencies which will be used
 - separate data into necessary directories
 - keep all the data information in specific files
 - run desired Static Analyzing Tools
 - construct the results data
 - create the charts of results
 - prepare the final statistics

This file will be updated continuously if idea becomes changed.
However, step by step changes will not be visible here rather.
So, please look at commits.

Sincerely,

H.A.
